                            excellent opportunities for Internships and excellent Placements.<br>
                            Over the years we have given our students opportunities to hone their skills through
                            execution of events that allow them to get a feel of the real working world and interact and
                            engage with leaders to get their perspectives. From engaging them on conversations of
                            ‘Excellence in Execution’ to giving opportunities to develop their business and social
                            networking skills, our faculty is happy to handhold each individual on their respective
                            paths to success. Our Faculty and Leadership is focused towards investing in our students
                            for their 360° development focussing on behavioural, attitudinal, skill, knowledge and
                            emotional quotient with a philosophy that “Education is the most powerful tool which you can
                            use to change the world.”

                        <p>
                            The Word evokes compliance, boredom and routine in our minds. It is also understood as
                            falling in line and towing an order. Do you think Sachin Tendulkar just towed an order of
                            his coach to achieve glory? Did Arjun only follow orders of Dronacharya to master archery?
                            Is it only about compliance of orders of their Gurus? How did Mr. Manjhi who single-handedly
                            made a road through the mountain, achieve it ?<br>
                            The Word also lets you follow a rigorous routine, relentlessly. It leads you to lead a life
                            bound by time and tasks. The word also induces perseverance to achieve against the odds.
                            Have you ever thought of people hailing from industrially and economically backward areas
                            making a mark in Civil Services examinations? They really make a mark in good numbers. Most
                            of these successful candidates in Civil Services are from rural areas, some of them deprived
                            of basic necessities of life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Have you ever thought how they achieve such lofty life goals especially when they are
                            deprived of finer aspects of living?
                            We all know the story of the Rabbit and the Tortoise. What differentiates them? Why you
                            think the Tortoise won the race ?
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                        <p>
                            So Tendulkar, Arjun and the Tortoise had many things in common like focusing on one thing at
                            a time, relentlessly following their objectives without distractions and odds and taking
                            small but continuous steps towards success. It may be time taking, frustrating & agonizing
                            but will lead to success if pursued continuously. As they say ‘It takes 20 years to become
                            overnight success.’ This ‘20 years to overnight success’ is possible by Discipline- the
                            Word! Put yourself before it and you make it even more possible.<br>

                            “In a time for drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually

                            The world is for learners. It is dedicated to their inherent curiosity, passion, dedication
                            and attitude. The words learned and learners are markedly different. The former is full of
                            ego and the latter thirsts for more knowledge. The processes of learning, unlearning and
                            relearning are ongoing. This defines the dimensions of knowledge. Our core identity as an
                            institution is in our definition as a <strong>“learning institution”.</strong>

                            defined a ‘new normal’. It has also united the world in its fight against the pandemic. The
