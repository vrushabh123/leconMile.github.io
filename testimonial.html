                            <p>Enrolling for PGDM at Lexicon Management Institute of Leadership & Excellence broadened
                                my horizons and honed my leadership skills. It helped me in the right direction in terms
                                of my career roadmap. The well-designed courses, the faculty who encourage
                                out-of-the-box thinking, the diverse cohort and the fabulous campus made my time at
                                Lexicon Management Institute of Leadership & Excellence memorable. The brand itself
                                provides the extra “MILE”, which can catapult you to great heights, professionally. I
                                believe change is the only constant in life. Finally, it’s time to step from campus to
                                corporate at AGS Transact Technologies Pvt Ltd as a Management Trainee.</p>

                                on hearing from my manager, mentors, placement heads when I keep the good work going. To
                                “BANG ON”, you need adequate environment, exposure, guidance, support and most important
                                discipline and Lexicon Management Institute of Leadership & Excellence gives all these
                                to passionate professionals out there. I would always be proud and happy to stay with

                                No one in the whole world will fight for you. You are the only idol of your life. When
                                you see your journey you will realise what you are and what you want to be.</p>

                                Resource as it kicked off along with PGDM at Lexicon Management Institute of Leadership
                                & Excellence. Looking back, I can certainly say that MILE was the most important
                                milestone in shaping my career. PGDM at Lexicon provides an innovative and practical

                                helped me build a rewarding career.Currently, I am working as Global Sourcing Specialist
